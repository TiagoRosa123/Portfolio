        <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
            I am a Computer Engineering student at CEFET-MG, passionate about technology, software development, and problem-solving. My focus is on backend development, embedded systems, and software engineering, with experience in C, JavaScript, and React.

        <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
            Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in projects that challenged my analytical thinking and coding skills. I developed a Hospital Management System in C and worked on an STM32 embedded system project as part of the Fórmula Cefast competition team. Additionally, I created a functional music streaming application in React, simulating core Spotify features.

        <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto">
            My experience extends beyond development. I worked in an international environment as a Business Development Intern at Zero to One Search, where I conducted market research and collaborated with global teams. This strengthened my communication skills and adaptability, making me comfortable working in diverse and remote teams.

            I am always looking to improve my skills, explore new technologies, and contribute to innovative projects. Let’s connect!
